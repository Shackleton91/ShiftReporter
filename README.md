## Coding Conventions

1. Use Arrow Functions ONLY
2. Components folder is for SHARED components
3. Pages folder is for the PAGE components
4. Use the assets folder and a 7-1 sass structure
5. const nameStr = "Andy";
6. const namesArr = ["Andy", "Ben"];
7. const isVisibility = false;
8. Components should use .jsx file extension NOT .js
9. classNames should use camelCase ONLY & import Styles from '..module.scss'
10. Strings should use " quotes rather than ' (except template literals)
